This is a personal project mainly created to play around with the following technologies:

# MongoDB - Java
# YUI - MVC Framework (i.e. the Models, Views, ModelList etc)
# REST Web Services using Jersey
# Bootstrap - Responsive CSS etc..


Idea is to allow user to create/update simple sticky note style cards, allow them perform a drag to delete and possibly other functions
